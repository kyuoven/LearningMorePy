find tool:

find --help
->  information about the find command

find .  -name "*.txt" -print
->  will find all .txt files and print them out in the terminal

find . -name "*.rb" -exec rm {} \;
->  deletes all Ruby files, the exec argument takes a command, 
    replaces any instance of {} with the name of the file, then stops
    reading when it hits the ;. we use \; because bash and many other 
    shells use ; as part of their language, so we have to escape it.
