# everyday homework/routine:
#       - write down at least three randomly combined words. Idiotic forests have iguanas. Python could summon aliens.
#       - think about these words, write about them. and don't censor yourself.
#       - during this exercise you might suddenly have actual ideas for programs, write them down somewhere else for later exploration.
